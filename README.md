 And add the following cache:
 <distributedMap id="cache" jndiName="cache/test"/>
 
 For tWAS:
 1. Optional: Create replication domain, if going to be used across servers.  (Environment > Replication Domains > New...)
 2. Create a new Object Cache and link Replication Domain, if using it.  (Resources > Cache Instances > Object Cache Instances > New...).  The JNDI name should be called "cache/test".  Make sure the cache is created at the correct scope.
